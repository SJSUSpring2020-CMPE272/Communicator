## Idea 1 :

__Project Title : Sign language Interpreter__
# Approved
__Description :__
Communication with people having speaking and hearing  disability is difficult for others. Other people need to get special training in sign language to communicate. This application can help people to communicate with them without having prior knowledge of sign language. It will be helpful to both groups of people.

This application will translate signs into text and speech to help people who cannot speak to communicate with other people. In addition to that, this application will also support speech to text conversion for people who don't have ability to hear.

__Goal :__
 - To ease the communication with deaf and dumb people. 
 - To enable more people to communicate with specially abled people. 

__Technologies :__
 - Machine Learning using TensorFlow
 - OpenCV
 - IBM Watson text to speech
 - IBM watson speech to text
 - Python and React

 
## Idea 2 :
__Project Title : Trip Advisor__

__Description :__
When people visit a new place, they are mostly on a clock and not sure of which places to prioritize. The application would help the users not to miss out on their places of interest. Users can click or scan a picture of a place. And based on past visits and other users with the same interest, the application would predict other places of interest to the user.

The application would be intuitive and  suggestions will include places in the same and nearby cities. The suggestions span from historical monuments to museums to eateries.


__Goal :__

Facilitate the users, so places they like.


__Technologies :__

 - Machine Learning.
 - Artificial Intelligence.
 - Node Js and React

 
## Idea 3 :
__Project Title :  Hate Content detector__

__Description :__

Twitterâ€™s mission is to give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information, and to express their opinions and beliefs without barriers. 

Research has shown that some groups of people are disproportionately targeted with abuse online. To minimize this we will develop a tool which will recognize those content and report it.

We will fetch the data from twitter streaming APIs and detect the hateful content . We will perform text sentiment analysis to detect the frequency of  words and provide visualization of gathered data.


__Goal :__

Social Media are sensors in the real world that can be used to measure the pulse of societies. It is a phenomenon that nowadays raises social alarms, especially when these messages contain hate speech targeted to a specific individual or group.

__Technologies :__
 - Python
 - Machine Learning
